# Galaxy Tool wrappers

This repo is part of my bachelor's project "Adapting Computational Tools for Microbial Evolution and Host-Association Analysis in [Galaxy](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy)".
It is a work in progress and I will add wrappers for tools and commands while I work on them.

Other repositories with Galaxy tools:

 * [IUC repo](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc)
 * [Björn Grüning repo](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools)
